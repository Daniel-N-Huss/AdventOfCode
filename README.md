# Advent of Code 

Hi There :) 

I made a small project for holding my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. 

I had originally set it up with a template in mind. This year I'll be trying different testing setups,
so will likely be changing the way these projects are laid out. If it makes sense I'll return some instructions!
